If you keep going backwards with the same people that God has intentionally removed from your life, you will continue to stay stuck. There is no joy in being confused and unhappy. Get rid of old bad habits and leave them where they belong. What is meant for you will be yours, learn to let go. Dysfunction isn't love.I have realised when someone is not meant to be apart of your life God removes them in any possible way. Just take it as a sign that person was never meant to be apart of your life and that God has a better plan for you. We may plan' but his plans are always better, where just not in a position where we can see the future. So take blessings from every loss. Stop thinking about how the past hurt you and start being thankful for what it taught you. Don't get caught up in emotions and don't pine for something that wasn't meant to be yours. Don't allow people with no purpose to distract you away from yours. Some people just don't deserve the opportunity to face you or the power to make you mad. You will get it wrong at times so expect to be judged, expect to be doubted, expect to be talked about, but understand that your mission is greater than your mistakes. Don't waste valuable time trying to prove yourself to pointless people. Accept where you've been, understand where you are, and focus on where your going. Let God handle the rest.
